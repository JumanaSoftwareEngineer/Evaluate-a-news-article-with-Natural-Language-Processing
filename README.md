### Introduction
This project provides a straightforward and efficient method to evaluate the sentiment and key details of news articles. Leveraging NLP techniques, it analyzes the textual content of a provided URL, offering insights into the article's sentiment, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and more.

#### Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Evaluate the sentiment of the news article (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Subjectivity Analysis:** Determine the subjectivity level of the article's content.
- **Confidence and Irony Detection:** Identify the confidence level and presence of irony in the text.
- **Dynamic User Interface:** Display the analysis results in a user-friendly interface.

##### Project Structure
- **src/client:** Contains the front-end code, including HTML, styles, and JavaScript.
- **src/server:** Houses the back-end code responsible for handling API requests and serving the front-end.
- **src/server/index.js:** Entry point for the server.
- **src/client/index.js:** Entry point for the front-end.
